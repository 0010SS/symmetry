# Symmetry: Agentic AI Processing Real-Time Market Info

You know that moment in conversation—  
*"Man, I wish I bought Tesla back in 2019..."*  
*"She made how much just by following the news early?"*

It always seems like someone else saw the wave coming… and rode it.

> **Is keeping up with the market — the edge of foresight — only for Wall Street banks and billion-dollar hedge funds?**

We don’t think so.  


## 🧠 Inspiration

We asked a simple question:  
**Why can't an individual have access to the same informational edge as a firm with a floor of analysts?**

With the explosion of public data and the rise of intelligent AI agents, we realized something:  
You can now run your own AI-powered research firm — from your laptop.

This is why we named ourselves, "Symmetry". Symmetrical information for everyone's access.


## 🤖 What We Built

We designed and deployed a **multi-agent AI trading research platform**, inspired by real-world investment desks, but driven entirely by **10+** autonomous AI analysts.

> **We integrated SOTA open-source trading agents and then leveled them up with (i) 2x larger new analysis pipelines, (ii) more in-depth debate modules, (iii) more strategic information ingestion, and (iv) more versatile output.**  
> Now, they read the news, analyze fundamentals, debate risks, and even make strategic recommendations — all in sync.

_(It’s like having your own Goldman Sachs... except it’s just you, a keyboard, and some very smart code.)_


## ⚙️ Under the Hood

Our system works like a **mini Wall Street firm in a box** — with AI agents taking on each role in the investment pipeline:

### 1. Company-Centric Analysts  
- **Stock Trend Analyst** → Spots indicators, patterns, and seasonality.  
- **Social Media Analyst** → Tracks sentiment and headlines from the crowd.  
- **Public News Analyst** → Monitors macroeconomic news and competitor signals.  
- **Fundamentals Analyst** → Digs into financial statements and ownership structures.  

### 2. Industry-Centric Analysts  
- **Cross-Signals Analyst** → Maps supply chain propagation and benchmarks companies against their industry peers.  
- **Industry Trend Analyst** → Identifies the industry to which the company belongs, spots indicators and patterns.
- **Industry Fundamentals Analyst** → Digs into financial statements and ownership structures of the industry's major representative firms. 
- **Industry Social Analyst** → Tracks sentiment and headlines of the entire industry.  

### 3. Debate Engine  
- **Bullish Researcher** → Argues for a *buy*.  
- **Bearish Researcher** → Argues for a *sell*.  
- **Neutral Judge** → Listens to both sides and scores the debate.  

### 4. Trader Agent  
- Decides: **Buy, Sell, or Hold?**

### 5. Risk Managers  
Evaluates the trade through three perspectives:  
- 🚀 **Aggressive Manager**  
- ⚖️ **Neutral Manager**  
- 🛡️ **Conservative Manager**  

### 6. Fund Manager  
Synthesizes everything into a **strategy report**, covering ideas about:  
- 📅 **Annual Investments** → grounded in fundamentals & industry growth  
- 📈 **Swing Trades** → capturing weekly to monthly momentum  
- ⚡ **Intraday Trades** → exploiting daily volatility  

**The result:**  
A self-contained **AI analyst firm** that debates, trades, and manages risk — without a single human lifting a finger. A visual pipeline can be found in the image attached.


## 💡 What We Learned

- **Autonomy requires clarity**: To make agents *think*, we had to teach them to *talk*. Prompt engineering wasn’t a one-liner — it was diplomacy.  
- **Markets are noisy**: Parsing real-time sentiment and fundamentals from structured and unstructured data challenged everything we knew about data flows.  
- **Modularity matters**: A true "firm of one" has to scale — and break — elegantly. We learned to design for chaos.


## 🚧 Challenges We Faced

- Aligning multi-agent debate without logic loops  
- Building a coherent world model from fragmented market data  
- Designing human-style strategy prompts that agents *understood*  
- Keeping the system lightweight, modular, and easy to fork
- Handling different data structures from APIs (and some were deprecated)
- Connecting backend output (free-form LLM-generated text) to frontend (requiring structured formats to be inserted into respective fields)


## 🚀 The Vision

What if…  
You didn’t need a Bloomberg terminal or a million-dollar research team to stay ahead of the curve?

> **What if you could run your own AI-powered investment desk?**  
> One that learns. One that debates. One that sees what others miss.

This isn’t a dream.  
It’s our project.  
And it’s just getting started.
