Risky Analyst: The bullish trajectory of TSLA is compelling with a strong +71.9% YoY return, significant distance above 50/200-day SMAs, and robust momentum confirmed by a rising MACD and supportive volume surges, indicating institutional interest and trend reliability. Despite an RSI overbought reading suggesting near-term caution and moderate-high ATR signaling volatility, these are typical in strong rallies and present opportunities for asymmetric tactical entries. The historically favorable September seasonality (~12% average gain) further underpins upside potential. Thus, the optimal approach is to selectively add exposure on confirmed pullbacks near structural support around 330 SMA, employing tight stops and pyramiding as momentum confirms. This strategy maximizes upside capture while containing downside, balancing aggressive growth pursuit with disciplined risk management.
