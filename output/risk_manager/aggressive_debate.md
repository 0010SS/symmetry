Risky Analyst: Tesla displays strong bullish fundamentals supported by robust momentum, positive September seasonality, and technical breakout signals reinforced by volume. Despite overbought RSI, the price remains above key moving averages with critical support near $330-$335 intact. The aggressive stance is to Buy on strength confirmation with staged scaling, tight risk controls, and readiness to trim or hedge if fundamentals deteriorate or support breaks. Pyramiding on validated trend continuations optimizes asymmetric upside capture while containing downside risk.
