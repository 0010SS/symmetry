**Executive summary:**
- 13 industry-level headlines noted; net sentiment negative (net score: -0.37) this week.
- Daily mention volumes peaked on 2025-09-08 (EV sales spike/tax credit expiry & Tesla share loss).
- Brightest narrative: Autonomy/robotaxi competition (Zoox launch, positive public reaction).
- Darkest narrative: EV demand spike tied only to U.S. federal tax-credit expiration (risk of demand cliff).
- Emerging theme: Lithium supply shock from CATL restart catalyzed a cross-industry commodity/stock sell-off.

**Volume & sentiment timeline:**  
- 2025-09-08: 4 major items, net negative. Drivers: U.S. EV sales spike caveated by looming tax credit loss and Tesla share dip ([link](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-solutions/2025/09/08/electric-car-sales-boom-tax-credit-deadline/)), ([link](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-market-share-us-drops-lowest-since-2017-competition-heats-up-2025-09-08/)).
- 2025-09-09: 3 mentions, net negative. Main catalyst: CATL lithium mine restart ([link](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/catls-yichun-lithium-mine-expected-resume-production-soon-securities-times-2025-09-09/)).
- 2025-09-10: Spike in autonomy/robotaxi coverage with generally positive/neutral sentiment; Zoox public trials ([link](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/amazons-zoox-robotaxi-opens-public-with-free-service-las-vegas-2025-09-10/)), regulatory debate ([link](https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a66068584/amazon-zoox-autonomous-ride-hailing-las-vegas/)).
- Sept 11–13: Neutral to negative, discussion on lithium pricing, BEV trends, and supply chain risks.

**Narratives & evidence:**  
- **Demand dynamics & incentives:** EV surge ahead of $7,500 U.S. credit expiry; concern for Q4 demand cliff ([WaPo](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-solutions/2025/09/08/electric-car-sales-boom-tax-credit-deadline/), negative, high confidence).  
- **Tesla competitive pressure:** U.S. EV share drops to ~38% ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-market-share-us-drops-lowest-since-2017-competition-heats-up-2025-09-08/), negative, confirmed).  
- **Lithium/raw materials:** CATL mine restarting, significant impact on supply/price volatility ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/catls-yichun-lithium-mine-expected-resume-production-soon-securities-times-2025-09-09/); speculated market overreactions, but supply risk real, med-high confidence).  
- **Autonomy/robotaxi:** Amazon Zoox launched public service (positive), intensifies debate with Tesla/Waymo ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/amazons-zoox-robotaxi-opens-public-with-free-service-las-vegas-2025-09-10/); neutral/confidence high re: competitive threat, confirmed).  
- **Market & supply chain risk:** Legacy OEM (GM) adjusts EV production—signals policy-driven demand swings ([The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/news/773492/gm-cuts-ev-production-tax-credit), negative, med-high confidence).

**Window sentiment roll-up:**  
- Positive: 2  
- Negative: 8  
- Neutral: 3  
- Net score: -0.37  
- Takeaways: Broader industry sentiment is cautious to negative, with single bright spot in autonomy/robotaxis. Commodity-related volatility is amplifying perceived EV sector risk.

**Actionable watchlist:**  
1. Watch September–October U.S. EV sales for reversal post-tax credit expiry.
2. Lithium contract/futures moves after CATL mine restarts.
3. Autonomy/robotaxi regulatory/pilot expansions (Zoox, Waymo, Tesla schedules).
4. U.S. EV incentive policy updates—Congressional/executive actions imminent.
5. BEV adoption data for Europe: OEM pipeline response and possible allocation shifts.
6. Cross-sector supplier reactions (battery/auto parts) to potential volatility in input prices.

**Non-obvious synthesis insights:**
- The U.S. EV demand spike is heavily front-loaded ahead of policy deadlines, suggesting a likely "air pocket" in demand in Q4—OEMs’ production pausing is a rare real-time indicator of incentive-driven volatility, now amplified in social-and-news markets.
- Robotaxi competition is shifting from a technology race to a public/regulatory adoption battle; Amazon Zoox’s publicity for public trials, not technical specs, is capturing more positive sentiment—Tesla’s autonomous narrative faces new, non-technical challenges.

**Confidence on key claims:** High for EV demand cliff and competitive pressure; Medium-High on input price/lithium volatility; High for robotaxi/AV coverage. Data sources cross-verified and not bot-amplified.

*Industry-level sentiment is net negative on TSLA’s primary sector, with caution around near-term demand and input prices, but significant long-term opportunity in autonomy and European BEV adoption themes.*
