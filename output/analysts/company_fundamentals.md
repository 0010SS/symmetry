The latest available fundamental information from recent analyses and forecasts on Tesla (TSLA) indicates a bullish price target trajectory ranging from about $310 to over $400 in the next month, suggesting positive market expectations and potential upward momentum. However, specifics on financial ratios such as PE, PS, and cash flow were not provided in the sources available.

No recent direct fundamental data on income statement, balance sheet, cash flows, capital returns, or ownership structure was accessible from the structured data tools at this time.

Insider sentiment and transactions data could not be retrieved due to technical issues.

Summary:
- Price targets from multiple market sources show optimism with targets rising from $310 in early August to over $400 recently.
- Market commentary includes positive responses to CEO Elon Muskâ€™s recent incentive package.
- Key financial metrics and insider activities are currently unavailable for deeper fundamental assessment.

I recommend further direct access to official financial statements or databases for robust fundamental metrics to supplement these market forecasts.

If you want, I can attempt to gather parts of the data from other available tools or focus on the next best information source.
