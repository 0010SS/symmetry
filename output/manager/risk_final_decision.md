# Final decision: **Hold**

Despite strong bullish momentum, positive seasonality, and technical support near $330-$335, significant risks including intensified competition, regulatory and legal uncertainties, valuation concerns, and near-term overbought conditions advise caution. Synthesizing all views favors maintaining existing positions without new purchases, employing risk controls and monitoring key technical and fundamental signals.
