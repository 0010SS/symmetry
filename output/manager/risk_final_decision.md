# Final decision: **Sell**

After synthesizing perspectives and firm evidence, the consensus favors reducing exposure to TSLA. Despite strong YoY growth (+71.9%) and bullish trends confirmed by price above 50/200 SMAs and rising MACD, the RSI over 74.8 signals overbought conditions with elevated ATR volatility. The 17.5% retracement from the 52-week high and stalled momentum near resistance recommend caution. A prudent strategy calls for trimming positions near current levels, securing profits, and awaiting a pullback near the 330 SMA support zone for potential re-entry, enforcing risk caps (max 30% portfolio size; max 3% risk/trade).
