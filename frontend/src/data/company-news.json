  "executiveSummary": "Tesla remains in a strong growth and innovation phase with surging stock momentum driven by robotics, autonomous vehicle expansion, and energy business developments. However, growing competition in EV markets globally is eroding its U.S. market share to multi-year lows and pressuring margins. The macroeconomic environment favors growth stocks with expected U.S. Fed easing lifting general investor sentiment. CEO Elon Musk\u2019s unprecedented $1 trillion pay plan highlights ambitious growth targets but raises shareholder governance concerns. Ongoing and pending class action lawsuits add legal risk. Regulatory approvals for robotaxis represent critical enablers of Tesla's long-term vision beyond traditional automotive. Overall, Tesla\u2019s prospects balance strong innovation-driven potential against intensifying competition and regulatory/legal headwinds.",
  "finalProposal": "HOLD with close monitoring of legal developments and competitive market share trends before considering new BUY positions."
