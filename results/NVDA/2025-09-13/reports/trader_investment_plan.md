Analyzing the provided investment plan for NVIDIA, the emphasis is on high valuation risks, geopolitical uncertainties, and the potential for market correction. The strategy recommends reducing exposure or holding off on new positions to mitigate downside risks, with an eye towards re-entering when valuation and macro conditions improve.

Lessons learned from past decisions underscore the importance of discipline, risk management, and adaptabilityâ€”especially avoiding overcommitment in overextended assets. Staying cautious in the current environment aligns with best practices in managing volatile growth stocks.

Considering the current market sentiment, macroeconomic backdrop, and the detailed caution outlined, the prudent move is to prioritize capital preservation over aggressive positioning. Therefore, I recommend adhering to the strategy of reducing or maintaining a minimal exposure to NVIDIA at this time.

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **SELL**
