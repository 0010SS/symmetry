Alright, here’s how I read this debate.

1.  What the bull really got right  
•  Core cash-machine: Even after the Reality Labs burn, Meta is throwing off >$50 bn of annual free cash flow and sits on a fortress balance sheet.  
•  Network effects that still matter: 3-plus billion daily users keeps ad buyers locked in and gives Meta the cheapest data set to train AI.  
•  Reasonable multiple for a mega-cap grower: ~26× forward EPS is not “bubble” territory for a company that can still grow earnings mid-teens simply by tightening costs and sharpening ad-tools.  
•  Long-term trend intact: Price remains above the rising 50- and 200-day SMAs. Consolidation ≠ breakdown.  
•  Visible catalysts: Meta Connect in September and continued AI-powered ad products could spark the next leg.

2.  What the bear correctly stresses  
•  Regulatory overhang is real and headlines will keep coming; fines and forced product changes are the one true tail-risk for Meta.  
•  Hardware / XR remains a sink-hole until proven otherwise; “$600 bn” spend, if close to accurate, could crush ROIC.  
•  Near-term momentum has cooled; MACD rollover, RSI mid-50s, and a flat 50-day say you don’t have to chase today.

3.  Where the debate tilts  
Valuation and cash flow: A 26× P/E on a business with double-digit top-line growth, 40% operating margin potential, and net cash is not egregious. Even if hardware flops, the core ad engine easily funds buybacks and dividends. That downside cushion outweighs the credible—yet not existential—regulatory threat.  
Regulation: History shows U.S./EU cases dent margins but rarely destroy the franchise (see MSFT, GOOG). Meta has already paid >$5 bn in fines yet EPS keeps climbing.  
Technical picture: Short-term wobble, long-term uptrend. That’s a textbook set-up to accumulate on weakness rather than stand aside entirely.

Decision  
BUY (with risk controls)

Rationale  
The bear’s worries are the right checklist, but none eclipse the combination of (a) still-dominant ad platform, (b) cash-rich balance sheet, (c) valuation that is merely “market-premium,” not speculative. Near-term chart softness is the gift that lets us build a position without paying the highs.

Detailed Investment Plan  

1. Sizing and Entry  
•  Target position: 4–5 % of equity portfolio.  
•  Phased buys:  
  – Buy 1/3 now (price sitting on the 50-day SMA).  
  – Buy 1/3 if shares pull back another 7–10 % toward the 200-day.  
  – Buy final 1/3 on a decisive close back above the 20-day after Meta Connect, signaling momentum has returned.

2. Risk Management  
•  Hard stop on entire position 15 % below 200-day SMA (where technical damage is confirmed).  
•  Trim 25 % of shares if a major adverse legal ruling materially raises fines/compliance costs (>10 % of annual FCF).

3. Optional overlay  
•  Sell 3- to 6-month out-of-the-money puts (10 % below spot) to get paid while waiting for a dip; use premium to finance far-dated 1.2× strike calls, creating a low-cost call spread.  

4. Monitoring checklist  
•  Regulatory tape: Track FTC/DoJ headlines; any forced product changes to ad-targeting warrant a fresh model.  
•  Hardware traction: Use quarterly active Quest head-set figures; if units flat for two consecutive quarters, haircut long-term XR assumptions.  
•  FCF conversion: Keep FCF margin ≥25 %. A slide below 20 % for two straight quarters triggers review.  

5. Exit / Re-rating  
•  Base case 18-month price target = 25× FY-26 EPS of $25 = $625 (mid-teens upside plus buyback-driven EPS creep).  
•  Upside case with XR/AI traction = 30× = $750+ (30-40 % upside).  
•  Downside fair value on core ads only = 16× $20 EPS = $320 (-30 %). The asymmetry still favors the long.

Learning from prior mistakes  
Previously I drifted to “Hold” when both sides sounded smart, then missed large moves. This time I’m committing—but capping risk with phased entries and a pre-defined stop. I’m also explicitly tying future action to measurable triggers (regulatory fines, FCF margin), not vague sentiment.

Bottom line  
Meta isn’t cheap enough to back up the truck, but it is good enough—financially dominant, reasonably priced, and entering an innovation cycle—to own now with a disciplined plan.
