**Non-obvious insights:**
1. Social media shows a paradox: while industry reports are overwhelmingly bullish, key community threads express concern about physical bottlenecks in advanced packaging and memory, hinting at a potential short-term supply-driven headwind despite robust demand.
2. The recent spike in revenue and capacity projections appears to create a multifaceted narrative, with optimism driven by policy and demand, but only cautious optimism regarding supply constraints; market perception could shift if bottlenecks materialize into actual shortages.

Final: **HOLD** (pending further supply chain developments and quarterly results).
