**Executive Summary:**
- Industry focus on TSMC’s booked advanced packaging and HBM memory tightness. Sentiment slightly negative (-0.22).
- Largest daily move: May 8, driven by HBM shortages and foundry capacity constraints.
- Brightest narrative: TSMC’s capacity constraints impacting AI hardware supply chain.
- Darkest: Memory tightness from SK Hynix and Micron, risking AI accelerator bottlenecks.
- Emerging theme: Supply chain pressures affecting multiple semiconductor segments.

**Volume & Sentiment Timeline:**
- May 3–4: Low activity, neutral sentiment.
- May 5: Spike in negative sentiment (~15 mentions) driven by SK Hynix HBM outlook (negative tone).
- May 8: Highest mentions (~23), mainly on HBM and TSMC capacity constraints, sentiment neutral to negative.
- May 10: Slight pick-up on supply bottleneck discussions, overall moderate activity.

**Narratives & Evidence:**
- **Supply chain constraints** (Confirmed): TSMC’s advanced-packaging capacity Fully booked (Sources: TrendForce, TechNode, Reddit), Confidence: High.
- **Memory tightness** (Confirmed): SK Hynix HBM sold out through 2025, Micron also constrained (Sources: AFP, Tom’s Hardware), Confidence: High.
- **Demand for AI chips** (Confirmed): TSMC’s recent sales growth, strong April figures (Reddit, industry reports), Confidence: High.
- **Rumor/Speculative:** Potential shortage effects on GPU pricing and lead times, but limited confirmed headlines.

**Window Sentiment Roll-up:**
- Positive: 0
- Negative: 2
- Neutral: 7
- Net score: -0.22
- Key point: Slightly negative sentiment mostly due to supply shortages, but no extremes.

**Watchlist:**
1. Monitor TSMC’s quarterly earnings for capacity updates (early June).
2. Watch for Micron and SK Hynix memory inventory reports next earnings cycle.
3. Observe GPU and AI chip pricing movements – potential short-term spikes.
4. Attention to geopolitical developments affecting Asia-based supply chains.
5. Track industry trade shows or announcements scheduled for late Q2.
